    "- **Computer simulation** is a powerful technique for answering questions about real-world processes. Simulation techniques that rely on probabilistic or chance events are known as **Monte Carlo simulations**. Computers use **pseudo random numbers** to perform Monte Carlo simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top-down design** is a technique for designing complex programs. The basic steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Express an algorithm in terms of smaller problems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Develop an interface for each  of the smaller problems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Express the algorithm in terms of its interfaces with the smaller problems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Repeat the process for each of the smaller problems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Unit-testing** is the process of trying out each component of a larger program independently. Unit-testing and **bottom-up implementation** are useful in coding complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spiral developement** is the process of first creating a simple version (prototype) of a complex program and gradually adding more features. Prototyping and spiral developement are often useful in conjunction with top-down design."

    "- An **object** is a computational entity that combines data and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects **know** stuff and can **do** stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An object's data is stored in **instance variables**, and its operations are called **methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every object is an **instance** of some **class**. It is the class that determines what methods an object will have. An instance is created by calling a **constructor method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An object's attributes are accessed via **dot notation**. Generally computations with objects are performed by calling on an object's methods. **Accessor methods** return information about the instance variables of an object. **Mutator methods** change the values of instance variables."

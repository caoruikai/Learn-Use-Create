# Minimum Configuration for using Rime Chinese Input on different OS

I peronally don't like to change a lot of useless configs, the only annoying default setting of Rime is the `Shift` key switchs between Chinese and English. My preference is to use the English input built in OS as default input method. Whenever I need to input Chinese, toggle to Rime using the OS hotkeys.

1. Add a patch yaml config file `default.custom.yaml` to correct path:

    - For Linux (Ubuntu 18.04, ibus-rime):  `vim ~/.config/ibus/rime/default.custom.yaml`
  
    - For MacOS (El Captain, 鼠须管): `vim ~/Library/Rime/default.custom.yaml"`
  
    - For Windows 10 (小狼毫）: `notepad %APPDATA%\Rime\default.custom.yaml`
  
2. Write the following into the yaml file to stop using `Shift` to toggle between Chinese and English:

   ```yaml
   patch:
     ascii_composer:
       good_old_caps_lock: true
       switch_key:
         Shift_L: noop
         Shift_R: noop
         Control_L: noop
         Control_R: noop
         Caps_Lock: clear
         Eisu_toggle: clear
   ```

3. Deploy Rime.

    - For Linux and MacOS, click the icon on menu bar, and then click `deploy` or `部署`.
  
    - Windows, there is `小狼毫重新部署` in start memu.

4. When typing for the first time using Rime, press `` Control+` ``. Choose`朙月拼音-简化字`.

5. Make sure English input is dafault (for Linux and Windows).

6. To keep consistency, change the switching key between input methods to:

    - Ubuntu / Windows: `Super+space`
  
    - MacOS: `Command+space`

For example, a quarterly compounded 5 years loan with 4% nominal annual interest rate is effectively the same with yearly compounded 20 years loan with 1% interest rate in our calculation.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The TVM calculation is always in the following fashion: given 4 out of the toal 5 values, and calculate the 5th missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `N` is the total number of periods. For example, if the number of years is 5, and the number of payments per year is 4 (compounding quarterly), the total number of periods is 4*5=20.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `I/Y` is the effective interest rate for each period (compounding every period). For example, if the nominal annual interest rate is 12%, and the number of payments is 12 per year (compounding monthly), then the effective interest rate per period (month) is 12%/12=1%. Also, 10% interest rate should be inputted as 10, not 0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There are two types of payments `PMT`: ordinary annuity and annuity due. Ordinary annuity makes payment at the end of each period, while the annuity due makes payments at the beginning of each period. The two modes on the calculator can be switched to each other using the key stroke `2nd` -> `BGN` -> `2nd` -> `SET`. When the annuity due mode is on, there is a `BGN` on top of the screen."

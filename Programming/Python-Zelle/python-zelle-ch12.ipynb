    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object-oriented design (OOD)** is the process of developing a set of classes to solve a problem. It is similar to top-down design in that the goal is to develop a set of black boxes and associated interfaces. Where top-down design looks for functions, OOD looks for objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation** Separating the implementation details of an object from how the object is used. This allows for modular design of complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism** Different classes may implement methods with the same signature. This maks programs more flexible, allowing a single line of code to call different methods in different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance** A new class can be derived from an existing class. This supports sharing of methods among classes and code reuse."
